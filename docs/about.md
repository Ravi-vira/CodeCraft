Concepts Covered: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, API development, authentication, and deployment.
Assignments & Projects: Details of various pull requests and contributions made.
Challenges & Learnings: Key takeaways from different tasks and how I overcame difficulties.
Code Samples & Best Practices: Important snippets and coding guidelines followed during the journey.
</code></pre>

## My Experience

During these three months, I had the opportunity to:

- âœ… Work on real-world projects and improve my problem-solving skills.
- âœ… Collaborate on GitHub through multiple pull requests (PRs) and learn version control best practices.
- âœ… Follow industry standards in code structuring, API design, and deployment strategies.
- âœ… Receive valuable mentorship and feedback from **Smaranjit Sir**, helping me improve my approach to Full-Stack Development.
